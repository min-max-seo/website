title: "My Journey of Learning Mathematics"

I want to be clear that I have completed my bachelor's degree in Honours Psychology and Joint Honours Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. I am also studying/researching mathematics education at Ontario Tech University as a part of my master's degree.

## Learning Math as a Middle School Student (Ages 12-13)

The first thing that my grade 7 math teacher did was to administer a quiz to test how much of middle school math we knew. Yes, I said middle school math. We were tested on materials that we had not been taught. The teacher expected many of us to know middle school math already, which was actually the case for some of my friends. One of my friends started learning calculus in grade 5. At this point of my life, I had never studied ahead of the standard curriculum - so I remember not knowing how to deal with negative integers on that quiz. It turned out that I scored 79% on my first math exam in middle school. I quickly learned that I will not be successful in math exams if I do not take an action at that point. My mother placed me in a math tutoring centre, and I was semi-forced into studying mathematics for 15-20 hours daily. Any other math exams after the first one, I got 100% - this was a forever game changer. Grades were a huge motivator for me. I thought I could do anything I want if I try hard enough.

## Learning Math as an Elementary School Student (Ages 6-11)

I was never particularly strong in math in elementary school years. Since my birthday is Dec 31, I was one of the youngest children in my grade. I was smaller and slower than other kids in my class until grade 3 (age 8). I still remember my summer vacation of the second grade being taken away because I could not memorize $9 \times 9$ table backward in one minute.
