Yes, I said middle school math. We were tested on materials that we had not been taught. The teacher expected many of us to know middle school math already, which was actually the case for some of my friends. One of my friends started learning calculus in grade 5. At this point of my life, I had never studied ahead of the standard curriculum - so I remember not knowing how to deal with negative integers on that quiz. It turned out that I scored 79% on my first math exam in middle school. I quickly learned that I will not be successful in math exams if I do not take an action at that point. My mother placed me in a math tutoring centre, and I was semi-forced into studying mathematics for 15-20 hours daily. Any other math exams after the first one, I got 100% - this was a forever game changer. Grades were a huge motivator for me. I thought I could do anything I want if I try hard enough."
