With intensive training in math, I was consistently one of the top-performing students in many Canada-wide math competitions. During my high school years, I was very lucky to meet AF, who became one of my greatest inspirations for studying math later on. His passion for math transferred to me well and motivated me to learn more mathematics. He was the vice president of Mathletes and was the first person to introduce me to the postsecondary level of mathematics.

Yes, I said middle school math. We were tested on materials that we had not been taught. The teacher expected many of us to know middle school math already, which was actually the case for some of my friends. One of my friends started learning calculus in grade 5. At this point of my life, I had never studied ahead of the standard curriculum - so I remember not knowing how to deal with negative integers on that quiz. It turned out that I scored 79% on my first math exam in middle school. I quickly learned that I would not be successful in math exams if I did not take action at that point. My mother placed me in a math tutoring centre, and I was semi-forced into studying mathematics for 15-20 hours daily. For any other math exams after the first one, I got 100% - this was a forever game changer. Grades were a huge motivator for me. I thought I could do anything I wanted if I tried hard enough. Then… I moved to Toronto as I turned 14."

The following is the list of all math-related courses I have taken during my undergraduate degree:\n\nproof-based algebra\n2 linear algebra courses\n3 calculus courses (advanced level)\nintro to combinatorics\ndesigning functional programs (advanced level)\nelementary algorithm design and data abstraction\n2 statistics\n3 data analysis courses (basic data analysis, advanced data analysis, data analysis and graphing in R)\nintro to real analysis\nelementary number theory\ndirected studies in number theory\nintro to formal logic\n\nIn my second year, I declared the Pure Mathematics major and added the Math Teaching major later on. I loved studying math, especially number theory. I was amazed by the beauty of the prime number theorem and by the applications of roots of unity. I was mathematically challenged to push my limit slightly further each time, and I learned so much from the process. The biggest gains I earned from the experience of studying math at the postsecondary level are resiliency and grit. No matter how hard the problem is, I am always ready to tackle it, and I never give up. However, during my third year, I realized that I would be much happier as a math educator (and as a math education researcher) than as a mathematician. I never felt a sense of belonging in the math faculty; I was always a foreigner in their math classes. I felt like my human-ness was erased in most of my math classes because so many pure math courses were operating without considering the importance of human-math interactions. Many instructors seemed to have forgotten the fact that they are teaching math to “people”. Of course, I have seen instructors who genuinely appreciated the human-ness of their math classes. These mathematicians knew how to honour the power and curiosity each student brings to the space, and I consider them as the “frontlines” of postsecondary math education. As a math education researcher, I want to do the research that supports these frontlines to enhance their practices with students."

When I first started my tutoring journey, everything was in-person. I would tutor at local libraries, cafes, and students’ homes. COVID-19 pandemic changed everything from in-person to online. As students got more comfortable with the idea of learning math online, I was able to make the decision to tutor online only. Do I believe in the power of in-person math instruction? I for sure do. However, online math tutoring was a more cost and time effective solution. I used those time and financial resources to develop a home office setting for online teaching and to make use of online software/tools like GeoGebra, Desmos, WolframAlpha, and collaborative whiteboard space.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I start working with a student, I always ask some questions to get to know them better. It is important that I know what energy each student is bringing into our shared online space. Oftentimes I learn a lot from my students even though I am the one in the teaching role. This is what I love about teaching: every single one of the students challenges my practices differently, and they help me shape my identity, values, and priorities as an educator."

One of my students said, “YES, it is empty!” Shortly after, I handed a box, which I purposefully put another empty box inside and sealed, to the student.

I still remember asking them, “When you listen to music, don’t you hear every note by its name?” I used to hate listening to an orchestra playing because it was extremely overwhelming, with too many layers of notes. For this reason, I always prefer listening to a soloist playing without any accompaniment. As a neurodivergent person, playing classical music has always been a “special interest” for me. Classical music has been a way to express myself when I did not have words to describe what I was going through. The piano and the viola are the most significant instruments out of all the other instruments I can play. I call the piano my parent instrument and the viola my lover."

    "text": "Learning How to Play the Viola as an Adult\nWhen I was living at a youth shelter, one agency kindly supported me to learn a musical instrument. I really needed a fresh start with music because I knew that I still had so much love and passion for classical music deep inside my heart. I asked if I could learn how to play the viola (in the violin family), and they made it happen for me. I was 19 when I started playing the viola. They got me a viola and an amazing musician, Rachael, as my viola teacher. I first shared my musical training background with Rachael, and that I wanted to be really careful with viola lessons so I could actually enjoy playing the instrument without re-traumatizing. Rachael was so amazing, and she helped me restore my love for classical music back. I practiced everyday for an hour at the basement of the shelter I lived in. It really kept me alive through the darkest days of my life. I learned so much about myself internally while practicing the viola because it helped me name the emotions I was feeling through the language of music. Viola music has its own clef, alto clef, so I had to learn how to read music again in a new clef. Rachael did not notice that I could not read alto clef until we finished our first book together because of my perfect pitch. I would just hear Rachael playing the piece, and I was able to repeat it on my instrument. As soon as Rachael found out I was doing that, she stopped playing for me so I actually had to read music. Learning a musical instrument as an adult was so different from learning piano as a child. I had all the music theory in my head as an adult but I was not able to naturally execute that knowledge well compared to children.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I have been playing the viola for 3+ years. I performed as a member of the UWaterloo orchestra, as a member in chamber ensembles, and as a viola solo at many events. I love sharing music with others, especially when we play together. Being in a quartet was a very unique experience for viola playing pianist like myself because I get to breathe music with other instruments similar to mine, which is rare for a pianist."

    "text": "Learning How to Play the Piano as a Child\n\n\n\n\n\nI started learning the piano at age 4. My mother was different from typical Asian parents. She had never asked or forced either of her children to study. However, there were three things that she considered important: playing an instrument, reading books, and physical exercise (I will probably raise my children in this way as well, if I decide to become a parent). She put me into a music school to learn piano. I learned piano very quickly, and soon after that, I found myself being professionally trained to become a concert pianist. I was asked to not leave the small practice room I was being trained in even at meal times. Finger foods were delivered to me as meals so I could eat at the same time as I was practicing. I spent so many hours in that small box/room - that was the entire world for me. At age 9, my mom found me another piano teacher who would come to my house to teach, so I was finally able to leave that music school with the small practice room. I studied with the new teacher for 2 years after that, until I realized I actually hated playing the piano in the way I had been and was brave enough to tell my mom about it. She allowed me to quit right after, and that was such a relief. Trauma from this intensive classical training period (up to age 11) was so deep, and it left a permanent damage to my musical life. I refused to go near a piano for years after that."

    "text": "Learning shapes who I am.\nWhen it comes to learning, there are reminders I give myself:\n\nLearning is a privilege\nEveryone deserves to learn\nNot every learning is visible\n\nI lived at a homeless shelter from age 17 to age 20 because I was not safe at home after coming out as a trans person. As a homeless youth, I faced a lot of other factors that affected my education, which I had never thought of before. I was still a high school student, and I had to go to school. From the shelter to my high school, I had to take 2 buses and 3 trains. I would wake up at 5 am, ask the night staff for the crappy sandwich that they gave out as school lunch, and head to school. Even then, I was still late for my first period which was physics. My physics teacher was upset with me because I was mostly not there. After school, I returned to the shelter as soon as I could because I could not afford to miss the dinner time (otherwise, I would have to fight for food during the night snack time). I did not have time to study because I had to survive through all the violence happening around me (and sometimes targeted at me) at the shelter. In order for me to use the washroom as a trans/nonbinary person, I was forced to ask the shelter staff every time to unlock the single-user washroom. I was really fighting for my human rights when I could simply “just” study.\nThe second shelter I stayed at was so much better than the first one. They had reliable and quality food, some staff who would advocate for my trans rights, and it was a lot closer to my high school. There, I was able to graduate from high school and apply to universities. They covered my university application fees. This shelter also had a program called Stay In School (SIS), and my undergraduate study was entirely funded by them. I was a resident of SIS until the second year of my undergraduate program. They also connected me with a tutor from UofT, and he really helped me stay interested in math. SIS also supported me to learn how to play the viola, and this musical interest of mine has grown to be an essential part of my well-being.\nWhat I learned from my experience of homelessness are reflected on the above reminders. I want to support other people’s experiences of learning through a trauma-informed practice. I dream of a society that learning is not a privilege anymore."
