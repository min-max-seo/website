Social Development Lab is a developmental psychology lab housed in the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I am currently working as a research assistant at the lab. These are some projects I have been part of:

## Validation of WRBS-Middle

The Waterloo Region Belonging Survey - Middle Childhood Version (WRBS-Middle) is designed to measure children's (aged 8-13) sense of belonging in non-school contexts. As a directed studies student, I lead the validation of the survey by

-   Examining the internal consistency, validity, and factor structure of the WRBS-Middle

-   Writing a formal report on the validation processes and results

## Data Cleaning of WRBS-Early

The Waterloo Region Belonging Survey - Early Childhood Version (WRBS-Early) is designed to measure children's (aged 3-7) sense of belonging in non-school contexts. As a research assistant, I am in charge of

-   Cleaning and merging children's data with their parents' data using R
